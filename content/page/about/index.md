I'm Zakarie Hassan Mohamed, a software engineer and AWS Certified Solution Architect based in Mogadishu. I've spent multiple years working with organizations remotely and on-site, building and maintaining systems that handle everything from patient data to enterprise resource planning.

I work across the full stack—backend, frontend, cloud infrastructure, and databases. Most of my recent work has been in Python, Go, and PHP, deploying applications on AWS, Azure, and GCP. I've built ERP systems from scratch, set up high-availability database clusters, and worked on healthcare platforms that require strict compliance standards.

Some measurable outcomes from recent projects: cut AWS costs by 35% through infrastructure optimization, improved server response times by 10%, and maintained database uptime at 99.9% with automated failover systems.
